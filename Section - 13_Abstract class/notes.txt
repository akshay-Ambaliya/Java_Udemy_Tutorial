
 
Two types of Class : 
    1. Abstract class : 
        -   abstract keyword is used
        -   we can not create object of abstract class
        -   we can declare reference of abstract class 
        -   If class is having abstract method then is must be declared as abstract
        -   But Abstract class may not have abstract method
        -   If some class is inheriting abstract class then it must override all of its methods, else it become abstract class
    
    2. Concrete class
        -   not any keyword is used
        -   we can create object of concrete class
        

Abstract Method : 
        - Method which is not having a body is known as Abstract method, the method must be declared as abstract
        - The abstract method is undefined method


Key Point To remember : 
    1.  An abstract class can't be final because if it made final then it cannot be extended whereas abstract class is meant for inheritance
    2.  An abstract method can't be final because if it made final then it can't be overriden whereas Absract method is meant for overriding
    3.  Abstract class and method can neither be final nor static
    4.  A Sub classs must override an abstract method or else it will become abstract class.
