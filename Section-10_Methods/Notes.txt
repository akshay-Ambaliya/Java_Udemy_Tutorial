
What are Methods : 
    methods are the members of the classes which provide functionality for the class
    eg : 
        length();
        substring();
        indexOf();
        equals();

How to write methods : 
    //Signature
    returntype methodName (Parameter List){
        .....
    }

main method can only call static method and member
 

Parameter Passing : (Call by Value) 
    - when method is called respective the parameters are copied, respective parameters are copied
        and a method will have its own copy of variable.
    - changes made in formal parameter is not reflected on actual parameter
    - but in the case of object, object reference is copied to formal parameter
    - actual object is also modified at the time of object Passing
    - Terminologies : 
        1. Method Call
        2. Called Mathod
        3. Caller
        4. Parameter/arguments
        5. Actual Parameter
        6. Formal Parameter

Method Overloading : 
    - means having more than one method with same name
    - It can be differ in parameter,return type,number of parameter
    - compiler will call the method based on parameters

Variable Arguments / Var-args
    - int ... x
    - we can pass any number of parameter of same type
    - we can even pass 0 arguments
    - must be the last 

Recursive Method : 
    - When method calls itself the it is called recursive method
