 Loop : repeating statement

Types Of Loop : 
    1. while
    2. do...while
    3. for Loop
    4. for each

while : 
        - condition check then executed
        - minimum execution : 0 times
        - used when number of iteration is not known
    
do..while : 
        - first executed then condition checked
        - minimum execution : 1 time

while(true){
    //It is an infinite loop
}

Note : Statement after infinite loop is never reachable that's why compiler gives error

for loop 
        - counter controlled loop
        - used when iteration is known
        - divided into 3 parts
        - (1) initialization
          (2) condition
          (3) updation
        - infinite for loop : for(  ;   ;   )

Nested Loop : Loop Inside Loop
            : Minimum Two loops are there  
                (1) Inner Loop
                (2) Outer Loop
