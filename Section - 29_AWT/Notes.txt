1) GUI : Graphical User Interface
2) CUI : Character User Interface

In java we can achieve GUI functionality using 3 framework

1) AWT : Abstract Window Toolkit
2) Swings 
3) JavaFX

There Some component Classes Are there 
1. Button
2. CheckBox
3. CheckBoxGroup
4. List
5. Choice
6. TextField
7. TextArea
8. ScrollBar
9. Layouts

    - GridLayout
    - GridBagLayout
    - CardLayout
10. MenuBar
11. Menu
12. MeunItems
13 CheckBoxMenuItem

Every Component have its own 
    - properties : 
    - method : 
    - Events : Every component Generate Events and to handel those event we require Event Listener interfaces
             : Some Events Are 
                -   ActionEvent :  ActinoListener
                -   ItemEvent : ItemListener
                -   MouseEvent : MouseListener/MouseMotionListener
                -   KeyEvent : KeyListener
                -   AdjustmentEvent : AdjustmentListener
                -   WindowEvent : WindowListener
                -   TextEvent : TextListener

    - Listener May have more than 1 method in interface so overriding every listener's method make code very complex
    - That's why Adapter Is there 

Adapter : Every Adapter have all the method present in its listener but it is class so that if we don't override every method then it's fine
