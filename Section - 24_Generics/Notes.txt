
Generics :
    - Before Object class is used for generalization 
    - But,it is not type safe (type cheking is not done at compile time)
    - Generics is type safe, It will provide error at compile time
    - We can make class capable of storing only one object, But object can be of any type
    - If we don't provide type to generics then it will be of object type
    - We can also provide multiple parameter 
    - If class is inherited by another class then sub class should be generics or parameter should be passed to super class 
    - We can also limit the parameter type like this : 
      <T extends Number> : this will allow only those classes which are extending from Number class
    - extends keyword is used for class and interface as well , Note that imeplements is not used 
    - we can define upperbound for parameter using super keyword means it can only hold the classes which is super class pf parameter class


Do's and Don't 
    - Only extends is allowed in generic class definition
    - extends is used for interface also 
    - extends from only one class and multiple interfaces
    - <?> will accept all types but cannot access
    - Base type of an Object should be same or ?
