/* All the Notes If Section 1 - Introduction */

JDK : Java development kit
	It will have compiler,development tool and java runtime environment

JRE : Java Runtime Environment
	Java Programs are executed in JRE
	Part of JDK
	Contains Java Class Library and JVM
	
JVM : Java Virutal Machine
	JVM resposible to execute java program
	Part of JRE



javac: Is an Compiler use to compile an java source file
	 Part of JDK
	 Generate .class File 
	
java: Executer use to execute an java .class file which is an byte code of an program

for example :
	we have file name as "first.java"

javac first.java 	--> generate "first.class" file
java first 		--> execute first class in java source file




* Skeleton of Java Program *

- Every java program is in the form of a java 

- main method : 

		public static void main(String args[]) {

		}

- main method must be public
- main method must be static
- main method should not return anything 
- main method must take parameter which is known as Command Line Argument
	It is optional at the time of passing it


- print statement : 

	System.out.println("Hello world ");

- System 	: Class 
- out 	: Object
- println	: method inside out

- If any class in source file declared as public then file name should be same as class name
- If we don't declare main method as above then we will find runtime exception (1)

* How to read Data from the Keyboard *

- Java Provides a class called Scanner used to take input from diffrent type of sources
- Scanner is Availabel in util package
- Some important Methods of Scanner Class 

	nextInt();
	nextFloat();
	nextDouble();
	next();
	nextLine();
	nextByte();
	nextShort();
	nextLong();
	nextBoolean();
	hasNextInt();
	hasNextFloat();


Errors : 

1) Main method not found in class first, please define main method as : public static void main(String args[])
